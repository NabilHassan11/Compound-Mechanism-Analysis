Assumption of dimensions of the mechanism that allow the system to have a crank (Link 2 makes full rotation) was made. Verification the satisfaction of the assumption for full cycle of the mechanismâ€™s motion was done using Linkage.
Animation of the chosen mechanism using Linkage software.
Using Polar (Analytical) Analysis to solve for:
o Position
o Velocity
o Acceleration
